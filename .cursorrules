You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Vite, with an emphasis on unit testing, readability, and preferring composition over inheritance.
  
Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components
- Follow Clean code principles
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Implement performance optimizations at the appropriate level
  
JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps
- Use type-only imports for TypeScript types (import type { Type })
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces
- Avoid one-line syntax for conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething())
- Use explicit type definitions and avoid type inference where it reduces clarity
  
Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages
  - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling
  
React
- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces
- Use declarative JSX
- Use function, not const, for components
- Wrap JSX returns in parentheses
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design
- Place static content and interfaces at file end
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Prefer local state for UI feedback with context for shared state
- Always clean up effects and subscriptions
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions
- Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user
- Use tanStackQuery for Data Fetching
